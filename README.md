# blue-gray-syntax theme

A dark (blue gray) syntax theme for Atom

Likely the code below does not still work
```bash
apm install blue-gray-syntax
```
This is an edited version of an Atom text editor syntax theme which I found on Github a while back. I have made some of my own changes and it seems the original theme is no longer available so I am posting this here for my own use mostly.
